    Calicoctl interprets the first sys.argv (after the file name) as a submodule.
    Calicoctl works on the assumption that each subcommand will have a python
    file sharing its name in the calico_ctl/ directory. This file should
    also have a function sharing that same name which accepts a single
    argument - a docopt processed input dictionary.

    Example:
      calico_ctl/node.py has a function called node(arguments)
